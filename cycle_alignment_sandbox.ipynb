The top trace is typical and shows three divisions before the circadian peaks, the second trace shows an early first division.\n",

Raster plot showing 3,160 traces (with at least two circadian peaks) aligned on the second circadian peak (blue), and sorted according to the interval between the first and second circadian peaks. Divisions (red) show a clear tendency to occur, on average, 5 h before the circadian peaks. A sparse group of early division events associated usually with longer circadian intervals is also visible.\n",

    "- Align time series to the first birth event.\n",
    "- Locate the subsequent metabolic cycle.\n",

    "    - I will also need to identify the troughs so that I only get one metabolic cycle (see heatmap in next main item).\n",
    "    - I expect this to be the most technically difficult.  If all else fails, plotting a heatmap with birth times overlaid 'for now' may still help produce insight.\n",

    "- Plot histograms that show the distributions of:\n",
