The top trace is typical and shows three divisions before the circadian peaks, the second trace shows an early first division.\n",
    "- B. Raster plot showing 3,160 traces (with at least two circadian peaks) aligned on the second circadian peak (blue), and sorted according to the interval between the first and second circadian peaks. Divisions (red) show a clear tendency to occur, on average, 5 h before the circadian peaks. A sparse group of early division events associated usually with longer circadian intervals is also visible.\n",

    "    - Start from the more reliable BY4741 or FY4 time series first, to iron out any issues.\n",
    "    - Real purpose is to do this with the mutants, especially with the `swe1_Del` from the Causton lab.  It's only going to be a matter of switching the dataset file.\n",
    "- Process data: cut time series to duration of interest (births matrix should be cut too), detrend flavin signals.\n",
    "- Align time series to the first birth event.\n",
    "- Locate the subsequent metabolic cycle.\n",
    "    - This may be through finding a peak, using the appropriate tolerance.\n",
    "    - Fitting an autoregressive model or Gaussian process may be helpful.\n",
    "    - I will also need to identify the troughs so that I only get one metabolic cycle (see heatmap in next main item).\n",
    "    - I expect this to be the most technically difficult.  If all else fails, plotting a heatmap with birth times overlaid 'for now' may still help produce insight.\n",
    "- Plot a heatmap that shows:\n",
    "    - Where the second birth event is in relation to the first birth event.\n",
    "    - Where the subsequent metabolic cycle is in relation to the first metabolic cycle.\n",
    "- Plot histograms that show the distributions of:\n",
